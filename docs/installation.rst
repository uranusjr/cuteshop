============
Installation
============

It is recommended you use pip_ to install. If you’re using Python 2.7.9 or 3.4,
it should be already present, otherwise you can find installing instructions on their manual page.

After you acquired pip, run the folloing in the command line::

    $ pip install cuteshop

Depending on your environment setup, you may need ``sudo`` to install Cuteshop
to your system path. We strongly recommend against it, however, and encourage
you to use virtualenv_ or Python 3.4’s new :py:mod:`venv` module to manage
it instead. Refer to their respective documentation for more information.
